# Neural Networks & Deep Learning Models

## Overview of the analysis
Using our knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, we will use the features in the provided dataset to help client create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Client provided a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

- EIN and NAME—Identification columns
- APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
- AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
- CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
- USE_CASE—Use case for funding
- ORGANIZATION—Organization type
- STATUS—Active status
- INCOME_AMT—Income classification
- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
- ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
- IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

This assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You will submit the following:

1. Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
2. Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
3. Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model
4. Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Neural Network Model (README.md)

## Results
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

1. Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?</p>
"IS_SUCCESSFUL" are the targets. Determining/Predicting what is causing a project to be a success or failed.
 
  - What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
 
 
  - What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?


2. Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  - What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
  
## Summary
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. 
Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
